A javascript implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game.

I used all my current knowledge to practice - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Initially, I planned out the javascript code by going through without a plan. I realise this is not an efficient or clean way to code because I would later realise that there needs to be more functions or better structures to deal with things. Writing steps down would have been clearer and would give a clear direction. 

As for the game code itself, it's relatively simple. I didn't require too much time as the logic of the game is simple, but the structuring of code required time. Things to improve in the future:
- Planning of steps before coding
- Testing small bits of code to see if it works, but due to console showing which line it stops at, it makes it easy to see where it goes wrong haha.


2ND UPDATE TO UI::
- Really fun to implement UI for the game. CSS is tough but it really improves the design of stuff. In the future, I would like to:
---- implement sound effects when hovering over object. Sound affects design so I wanna do alot of stuff with sound. 
---- display results in a more fun way?
